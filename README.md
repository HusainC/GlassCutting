# GlassCutting
This is my university project where I had to add shapes in boxes based on knapsack and binpacking problems with restrictions of box size and number of 
shapes in a box and shelves. The correctness of the code is done using JUnit and the efficiency is also tested.
The concept of greedy algorithms has been used for this piece of code.
 
For solving the Glass Cutting Problem (GCP) i have used :
 NFGCP: based on Next Fit strategy for solving Bin Packing Problems.
 FFGCP: based on First Fit strategy for solving Bin Packing Problems. 
All the testing has been done using Junit in the Correctness Testing class and the performace has been tested in the Perm=formanceTest class.
